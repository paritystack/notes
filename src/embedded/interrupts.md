# Interrupts


## Overview

Interrupts are signals that temporarily halt the normal execution of a program or process, allowing the system to respond to important events. They are a crucial mechanism in computer architecture, enabling efficient multitasking and real-time processing.

## Types of Interrupts

1. **Hardware Interrupts**: Generated by hardware devices (e.g., keyboard, mouse, network cards) to signal that they require attention from the CPU. These interrupts can occur at any time and are typically prioritized to ensure that critical tasks are handled promptly.

2. **Software Interrupts**: Triggered by software instructions, such as system calls or exceptions. These interrupts allow programs to request services from the operating system or handle errors gracefully.

3. **Timer Interrupts**: Generated by a timer within the system to allow the operating system to perform regular tasks, such as scheduling processes and managing system resources.

## Interrupt Handling

When an interrupt occurs, the CPU stops executing the current program and saves its state. The system then executes an interrupt handler, a special routine designed to address the specific interrupt. After the handler completes its task, the CPU restores the saved state and resumes the interrupted program.

## Applications of Interrupts

- **Real-Time Systems**: Interrupts are essential in real-time systems where timely responses to events are critical, such as in embedded systems, automotive applications, and industrial automation.

- **Multitasking**: Operating systems use interrupts to manage multiple processes efficiently, allowing them to share CPU time and resources without significant delays.

- **Event-Driven Programming**: In event-driven architectures, interrupts facilitate the handling of user inputs and other events, enabling responsive applications.

## Conclusion

Understanding interrupts is vital for developers working with low-level programming, operating systems, and embedded systems. They play a key role in ensuring that systems can respond quickly and efficiently to a variety of events.
