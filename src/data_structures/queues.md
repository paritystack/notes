A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. Queues are commonly used in scenarios where order needs to be preserved, such as in scheduling tasks, managing requests in a server, or handling asynchronous data.

### Key Operations
1. **Enqueue**: Add an element to the end of the queue.
2. **Dequeue**: Remove an element from the front of the queue.
3. **Peek/Front**: Get the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
4. **IsEmpty**: Check if the queue is empty.
5. **Size**: Get the number of elements in the queue.

### Types of Queues
- **Simple Queue**: Also known as a linear queue, where insertion happens at the rear and deletion happens at the front.
- **Circular Queue**: A more efficient queue where the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle.
- **Priority Queue**: Each element is associated with a priority, and elements are served based on their priority.
- **Double-ended Queue (Deque)**: Insertion and deletion can happen at both the front and the rear of the queue.

### Applications of Queues
- **CPU Scheduling**: Managing processes in operating systems.
- **Disk Scheduling**: Managing I/O requests.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
- **Print Queue**: Managing print jobs in a printer.

Queues are fundamental data structures that are widely used in computer science and programming for managing ordered collections of items.
