# System Design

Designing large-scale distributed systems for performance, scalability, and reliability.

## Topics Covered

- **[Scalability](scalability.md)**: Horizontal vs vertical scaling, load balancing strategies
- **[Caching](caching.md)**: Cache strategies, invalidation, distributed caching
- **[RPC](rpc.md)**: Remote Procedure Call frameworks and patterns
- **[Microservices](microservices.md)**: Microservices architecture patterns, service decomposition, communication patterns
- **Databases**: SQL vs NoSQL, sharding, replication
- **Message Queues**: Asynchronous processing, event-driven architecture
- **Distributed Consensus**: Consistency models, CAP theorem
- **Design Patterns**: Common solutions for distributed systems

## Key Concepts

- **Throughput**: Requests per second
- **Latency**: Response time
- **Availability**: Uptime percentage
- **Consistency**: Data correctness
- **Partition Tolerance**: Handling failures

## Design Goals

1. **Reliability**: Surviving failures
2. **Scalability**: Growing with demand
3. **Performance**: Fast responses
4. **Maintainability**: Easy to update

## Steps to Design System

1. Understand requirements and constraints
2. High-level architecture
3. Detailed design of components
4. Identify bottlenecks
5. Trade-offs and optimization
