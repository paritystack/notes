# System Design

Designing large-scale distributed systems for performance, scalability, and reliability.

## Topics Covered

- **Scalability**: Horizontal vs vertical scaling
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing traffic
- **Caching**: Improving performance
- **Databases**: SQL vs NoSQL, sharding
- **Message Queues**: Asynchronous processing
- **Microservices**: Service architecture
- **Distributed Consensus**: Consistency models
- **Design Patterns**: Common solutions

## Key Concepts

- **Throughput**: Requests per second
- **Latency**: Response time
- **Availability**: Uptime percentage
- **Consistency**: Data correctness
- **Partition Tolerance**: Handling failures

## Design Goals

1. **Reliability**: Surviving failures
2. **Scalability**: Growing with demand
3. **Performance**: Fast responses
4. **Maintainability**: Easy to update

## Steps to Design System

1. Understand requirements and constraints
2. High-level architecture
3. Detailed design of components
4. Identify bottlenecks
5. Trade-offs and optimization
