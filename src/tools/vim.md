# Vim

Vim is a powerful text editor that is widely used in the Unix and Linux communities. It is a modal editor, meaning that it has two modes: normal mode and insert mode. In normal mode, you can navigate the text using the arrow keys or the mouse, and you can use commands to manipulate the text.
