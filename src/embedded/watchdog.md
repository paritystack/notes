# Watchdog Timers

A Watchdog Timer (WDT) is a hardware or software timer that is used to detect and recover from computer malfunctions. During normal operation, the system regularly resets the watchdog timer to prevent it from elapsing, or "timing out." If the system fails to reset the watchdog timer, it is assumed to be malfunctioning, and corrective actions are taken, such as resetting the system.

## Key Concepts

- **Timeout Period**: The duration for which the watchdog timer runs before it times out. If the timer is not reset within this period, it triggers a system reset or other corrective actions.
- **Reset Mechanism**: The action taken when the watchdog timer times out. This is typically a system reset, but it can also include other actions like logging an error or entering a safe state.
- **Feeding the Watchdog**: The process of regularly resetting the watchdog timer to prevent it from timing out. This is also known as "kicking" or "patting" the watchdog.

## Example Usage

1. **Embedded Systems**: Watchdog timers are commonly used in embedded systems to ensure that the system can recover from unexpected failures. For example, if a microcontroller stops responding, the watchdog timer can reset it to restore normal operation.
2. **Safety-Critical Applications**: In applications where safety is paramount, such as automotive or medical devices, watchdog timers help ensure that the system can recover from faults and continue to operate safely.

## Conclusion

Watchdog timers are essential components in many systems, providing a mechanism to detect and recover from malfunctions. Understanding how to configure and use watchdog timers is crucial for developing reliable and resilient systems.
