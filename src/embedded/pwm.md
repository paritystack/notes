# PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)

Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is a technique used to control the amount of power delivered to an electrical device by varying the width of the pulses in a pulse train. It is commonly used in applications such as motor control, LED dimming, and signal generation.

## Key Concepts

- **Duty Cycle**: The duty cycle is the percentage of one period in which a signal is active. A higher duty cycle means more power is delivered to the device.

- **Frequency**: The frequency of the PWM signal determines how fast the pulses are repeated. It is important to choose an appropriate frequency for the application to ensure smooth operation.

## Example Usage

1. **LED Dimming**: By adjusting the duty cycle of a PWM signal, you can control the brightness of an LED. A higher duty cycle results in a brighter LED.

2. **Motor Speed Control**: PWM can be used to control the speed of a DC motor. By varying the duty cycle, you can adjust the average voltage supplied to the motor, thus controlling its speed.

## Conclusion

PWM is a versatile technique that allows for efficient control of power in various applications. Understanding how to implement and utilize PWM can greatly enhance the performance of electronic devices.
