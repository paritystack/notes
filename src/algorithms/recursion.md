# Recursion

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. It is often used to break down complex problems into simpler subproblems.

## Key Concepts

- **Base Case**: The condition under which the recursion ends. It prevents infinite loops and allows the function to return a result.

- **Recursive Case**: The part of the function where the recursion occurs, typically involving a call to the same function with modified arguments.

## Common Recursive Algorithms

1. **Factorial Calculation**: The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It can be defined recursively as:
   - `factorial(n) = n * factorial(n - 1)` with the base case `factorial(0) = 1`.

2. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. It can be defined recursively as:
   - `fibonacci(n) = fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)` with base cases `fibonacci(0) = 0` and `fibonacci(1) = 1`.

3. **Binary Search**: A search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. It can be implemented recursively by dividing the array in half:
   - If the target is less than the middle element, search the left half; if greater, search the right half.

## Applications

Recursion is widely used in various applications, including:

- **Tree Traversals**: Navigating through tree data structures using recursive methods.
- **Backtracking Algorithms**: Solving problems incrementally by trying partial solutions and then abandoning them if they fail to satisfy the conditions.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Many dynamic programming problems can be solved using recursive approaches with memoization to optimize performance.

## Conclusion

Recursion is a powerful tool in programming that allows for elegant solutions to complex problems. Understanding how to effectively use recursion is essential for developing efficient algorithms in computer science and software engineering.
