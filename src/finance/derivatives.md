# Derivatives

## Overview

Derivatives are financial contracts whose value derives from an underlying asset. Beyond options and futures (covered in separate guides), this document covers swaps, forwards, and exotic derivatives.

## Types of Derivatives

### Swaps
- **Interest Rate Swaps**: Exchange fixed for floating rates
- **Currency Swaps**: Exchange cash flows in different currencies
- **Commodity Swaps**: Lock in commodity prices
- **Credit Default Swaps (CDS)**: Insurance against default

### Forwards
- **Forward Contracts**: Like futures but OTC, customized
- **FX Forwards**: Currency hedging
- **Forward Rate Agreements (FRA)**: Interest rate hedging

### Exotic Options
- **Barrier Options**: Activated/deactivated at price levels
- **Asian Options**: Payout based on average price
- **Binary Options**: All-or-nothing payout
- **Lookback Options**: Based on maximum/minimum price

## Use Cases

### Hedging
- **Interest Rate Risk**: Swap fixed for floating
- **Currency Risk**: Forward contracts
- **Commodity Price Risk**: Commodity swaps
- **Credit Risk**: Credit default swaps

### Speculation
- **Leverage**: Control large positions with small capital
- **Directional Bets**: Options, futures
- **Volatility Trading**: Straddles, strangles
- **Arbitrage**: Exploit price inefficiencies

### Income Generation
- **Covered Calls**: Sell calls on owned stock
- **Cash-Secured Puts**: Sell puts, willing to buy
- **Iron Condors**: Sell spreads for credit

## Risks

1. **Leverage Risk**: Magnified losses
2. **Counterparty Risk**: OTC derivatives
3. **Complexity Risk**: Difficult to understand
4. **Liquidity Risk**: Hard to exit positions
5. **Mark-to-Market Risk**: Daily P&L swings
6. **Tail Risk**: Extreme events

## Best Practices

- Use derivatives for hedging, not speculation (for most investors)
- Understand the product completely
- Use exchange-traded when possible (lower counterparty risk)
- Size positions appropriately
- Monitor regularly
- Have exit strategy
