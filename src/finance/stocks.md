## Key Financial Ratios

### Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E)

The Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) is a fundamental valuation tool that compares a company's current share price to its earnings per share (EPS). It is expressed as:

$$
P/E = \frac{Price\ per\ Share}{Earnings\ per\ Share}
$$

A high P/E ratio might suggest that a stock is overvalued or that investors anticipate significant growth. Conversely, a low P/E ratio could indicate undervaluation or potential challenges faced by the company.

### Price to Book Ratio (P/B)

The Price to Book Ratio (P/B) evaluates a company's market value against its book value. It is determined by:

$$
P/B = \frac{Market\ Price\ per\ Share}{Book\ Value\ per\ Share}
$$

The book value represents the net asset value, calculated as total assets minus intangible assets and liabilities. A lower P/B ratio may signal undervaluation, while a higher ratio could imply overvaluation.

### Debt to Equity Ratio (D/E)

The Debt to Equity Ratio (D/E) assesses a company's financial leverage by comparing its total liabilities to shareholder equity. It is calculated as:

$$
D/E = \frac{Total\ Liabilities}{Shareholder\ Equity}
$$

A higher D/E ratio indicates greater reliance on debt for financing, which can be risky if not managed well. A lower ratio suggests a more conservative financial strategy.

### Return on Equity (ROE)

Return on Equity (ROE) measures a company's profitability by comparing net income to shareholder equity. It is expressed as:

$$
ROE = \frac{Net\ Income}{Shareholder\ Equity}
$$

A higher ROE signifies effective profit generation from equity investments, serving as a crucial indicator of financial performance and efficiency.

### Current Ratio

The Current Ratio is a liquidity metric that evaluates a company's ability to meet short-term obligations with its current assets. It is calculated as:

$$
Current\ Ratio = \frac{Current\ Assets}{Current\ Liabilities}
$$

A higher current ratio suggests strong short-term financial health, while a lower ratio may indicate potential liquidity challenges.

### Quick Ratio

The Quick Ratio, or acid-test ratio, is a stringent liquidity measure that excludes inventory from current assets. It is calculated as:

$$
Quick\ Ratio = \frac{Current\ Assets - Inventory}{Current\ Liabilities}
$$

A higher quick ratio indicates the ability to meet short-term obligations without relying on inventory sales.

### Dividend Yield

The Dividend Yield reflects the annual dividend income relative to the market price per share. It is calculated as:

$$
Dividend\ Yield = \frac{Annual\ Dividends\ per\ Share}{Price\ per\ Share}
$$

A higher dividend yield suggests a company is returning more income to shareholders, appealing to income-focused investors.

### Earnings Per Share (EPS)

Earnings Per Share (EPS) is a critical profitability metric indicating the profit generated per share of stock. It is calculated as:

$$
EPS = \frac{Net\ Income - Dividends\ on\ Preferred\ Stock}{Average\ Outstanding\ Shares}
$$

A higher EPS reflects better profitability and is a key factor for investors assessing financial health.

### Price to Sales Ratio (P/S)

The Price to Sales Ratio (P/S) compares a company's market capitalization to its total sales or revenue. It is expressed as:

$$
P/S = \frac{Market\ Capitalization}{Total\ Sales}
$$

A lower P/S ratio may indicate undervaluation, while a higher ratio could suggest overvaluation, especially useful for companies with minimal earnings.

### Conclusion

Analyzing these financial ratios offers valuable insights into a company's valuation, financial health, and performance. Investors leverage these metrics to make informed decisions and compare companies within the same industry.
