# Personal Financial Planning

## Overview

Financial planning is the process of managing your finances to achieve life goals. This includes budgeting, saving, investing, insurance, tax planning, and retirement planning.

## Financial Planning Steps

### 1. Set Financial Goals

**Short-term (< 1 year):**
- Emergency fund
- Pay off credit cards
- Save for vacation

**Medium-term (1-5 years):**
- Save for house down payment
- Pay off student loans
- Build investment portfolio

**Long-term (5+ years):**
- Retirement
- Children's education
- Financial independence

### 2. Assess Current Situation

**Net Worth Calculation:**
```
Assets:
- Cash: $X
- Investments: $Y
- Home equity: $Z
- Other assets: $W

Liabilities:
- Mortgage: $A
- Student loans: $B
- Credit cards: $C
- Other debt: $D

Net Worth = Total Assets - Total Liabilities
```

**Cash Flow Analysis:**
```
Monthly Income: $X
Monthly Expenses: $Y
Monthly Savings: $X - $Y

Savings Rate = Monthly Savings / Monthly Income
```

### 3. Create a Budget

**50/30/20 Rule:**
- 50% Needs (housing, food, utilities, insurance)
- 30% Wants (entertainment, dining, hobbies)
- 20% Savings/Debt Repayment

**Zero-Based Budget:**
- Assign every dollar a job
- Income - Expenses = $0
- Forces intentional spending

## Emergency Fund

**Amount Needed:**
- **Minimum**: 3 months of expenses
- **Recommended**: 6 months of expenses
- **Self-employed**: 12 months of expenses

**Where to Keep It:**
- High-yield savings account (2-5% APY)
- Money market fund
- NOT in stocks (too volatile)

## Debt Management

### Debt Payoff Strategies

**Debt Avalanche (Mathematically Optimal):**
1. Pay minimums on all debts
2. Extra payments to highest interest rate debt
3. When paid off, attack next highest rate

**Debt Snowball (Psychologically Motivating):**
1. Pay minimums on all debts
2. Extra payments to smallest balance
3. Quick wins build momentum

### Good Debt vs. Bad Debt

**Good Debt:**
- Mortgage (builds equity, tax deductible, low rate)
- Student loans (investment in earning power)
- Business loans (invest in revenue generation)

**Bad Debt:**
- Credit cards (high interest)
- Auto loans (depreciating asset)
- Personal loans (consumption)

**Rule:** If interest rate > 6-7%, prioritize paying it off

## Retirement Planning

### How Much to Save

**Retirement Number:**
```
Annual Expenses in Retirement: $X
Multiply by 25 (4% rule): $X × 25

Example:
Need $60,000/year in retirement
Retirement target: $60,000 × 25 = $1,500,000
```

**Alternative - Percentage of Income:**
- Start at 25: Save 15% of income
- Start at 35: Save 25% of income
- Start at 45: Save 35% of income
- Start at 55: Save 50%+ of income

### Retirement Accounts (US)

**401(k):**
- Employer-sponsored
- 2024 limit: $23,000 ($30,500 if 50+)
- Employer match = free money
- Traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (after-tax)

**IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
- 2024 limit: $7,000 ($8,000 if 50+)
- Traditional: Tax deduction now, taxed in retirement
- Roth: No deduction, tax-free in retirement

**Roth vs. Traditional Decision:**
- **Choose Roth if**: Young, lower tax bracket now
- **Choose Traditional if**: High earner, expect lower retirement bracket

**Priority Order:**
1. 401(k) to employer match (free money)
2. Max Roth IRA
3. Max 401(k)
4. HSA (if eligible)
5. Taxable brokerage

### Retirement Withdrawal Strategies

**4% Rule:**
- Withdraw 4% of portfolio first year
- Adjust for inflation each year
- Historically safe for 30-year retirement

**Dynamic Withdrawal:**
- Adjust based on market performance
- Cut spending in down years
- Increases longevity of portfolio

**Bucket Strategy:**
- Bucket 1: 2 years cash (safety)
- Bucket 2: 8 years bonds (stability)
- Bucket 3: 20+ years stocks (growth)

## Insurance Planning

### Essential Insurance

**Health Insurance:**
- Mandatory, protects against medical bankruptcy
- HDHP + HSA = tax-advantaged savings

**Life Insurance:**
- **Need if:** Others depend on your income
- **Amount:** 10-12× annual income
- **Type:** Term life (not whole life for most)

**Disability Insurance:**
- Protects income if unable to work
- Often provided by employer
- Consider supplemental if high earner

**Property Insurance:**
- Homeowners/Renters insurance
- Auto insurance (legally required)
- Umbrella policy for high net worth ($1M+ coverage)

### Insurance to Usually Avoid

- Whole/Universal life (high fees, complexity)
- Extended warranties (overpriced)
- Credit card insurance
- Travel insurance (unless expensive trip)

## Tax Planning

### Tax-Advantaged Strategies

### Tax Brackets (Illustrative - 2024)

**Single Filers:**
- 10%: $0 - $11,600
- 12%: $11,600 - $47,150
- 22%: $47,150 - $100,525
- 24%: $100,525 - $191,950
- 32%: $191,950 - $243,725
- 35%: $243,725 - $609,350
- 37%: $609,350+

## Financial Independence / FIRE

**FIRE = Financial Independence, Retire Early**

**Key Principles:**

- **Fat FIRE**: Higher expenses ($100k+/year)
- **Barista FIRE**: Part-time work covers expenses, investments grow

**Calculation:**
```
Annual Expenses: $40,000
FI Number: $40,000 × 25 = $1,000,000
Savings Rate: 60%
Years to FI: ~12-15 years
```
